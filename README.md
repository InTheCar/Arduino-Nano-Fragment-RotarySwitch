# Arduino-Nano-Fragment-RotarySwitch
 rotary switch for the Arduino Nano

 This small project show how to use a A/D converter for a rotary switch.

# Current calculation
 It's a single-pole switch with 11 positions. Between the positions a 1K
 resistor is used.

 The resistors are connected in series at 5V
 The total is 10 x 1k = 10k
 I=5V/10k=0,5mA
